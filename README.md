# App Notice SDK for iOS<br/>Installation and Customization
*Version: 1.1*</br>
January 2016

## Features

- [x] Implied Consent Tracking
- [x] Explicit Consent Tracking
- [x] Customize SDK Colors
- [x] Remote and Offline Support
- [x] User Tracking Toggling
- [x] iOS 9 Support

## Prerequisites

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7.0+
- A valid App Notice ID from the Ghostery control panel. See the [Companion Guide](Ghostery SDK Companion Guide.pdf) for details.

##Example Projects

This repo comes with two example projects to demonstrate how to use the SDK. One project is in Swift and the other in Objective-C.

## Installation

To use the AppNoticeSDK first download or clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ghostery/AppNoticeSDK-iOS.git
```

To integrate AppNoticeSDK into your Xcode project:

Copy/drag `AppNoticeSDKFramework.framework` and `AppNotice.bundle` into your Xcode project:

### Swift

  1.  Creating a bridging header file:
  <br>
![](http://i.imgur.com/WOWD1gH.png)

  2.  Include the Objective-C import inside that bridging header:

```objective-c
//  Triangle_swift-Bridging-Header.h
//  Triangle_swift
//
//  Created by Mark Price on 9/24/15.
//  Copyright Â© 2015 Ghostery. All rights reserved.
//

#import <AppNoticeSDKFramework/AppNoticeSDKFramework.h>
```

### Objective-C

Simply include the framework import statement wherever you want to use it

```objective-c
#import <AppNoticeSDKFramework/AppNoticeSDKFramework.h>
```

## Usage

### Activation<a name="activation"></a>

You must activate the SDK before you can use the SDK features. You do so using your Company ID and Publisher Notice ID.

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().activateWithCompanyId("242", pubNoticeId: "6107")
```

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance] activateWithCompanyId:@"242" pubNoticeId:@"6107"];
```

### Asking For Consent

There are two types of consent: **Implied** and **Explicit**. This setting is determined by your Publisher Notice ID.

#### Implied Consent
Implied consent is a read-only option. It basically informs the user that he is automaticaly giving consent simply by continuing to use the app. Therefore, it does not include **Accept** or **Decline** options.

#### Explicit Consent
Explicit consent must either be accepted or declined by the user. If consent is accepted, your app may proceed as usual. However, if consent is declined there are a few cases that you'll need to handle:
- If your app is fully functional without depending on any third party trackers, you can simply disable all trackers and let the user continue using the app.
- If your app depends on any trackers that cannot be disabled, you must prevent the user from using the app (or at least the parts of the app that require trackers). If your app will allow the user to continue to use the app with limited functionality, notify the user about the limitations. You might say something like: "To enjoy the full functionality of this app, you must accept the privacy preferences in the app's settings. This app will now continue with limited functionality."
- Inform the user if your app requires a restart before any newly changed tracker settings can take effect. Some trackers may require an app restart to be fully enabled/disabled.
- Users have the right to withdraw consent at any time, even after they've already given it. The SDK's [Manage Preferences View](#preferences) should be accessible from within your app for this purpose. (This may typically be in some kind of app settings or preferences view, for example.)

#### Presenting the Consent Dialog
To be fully compliant with privacy regulations, you should ask for the user's consent as early as possible after your app launches. You can do this by presenting the SDK's consent dialog:

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().showConsentFlowWithOnClose { (consentAccepted, consentSkipped, trackers) -> Void in
    // TODO: Handle what you want to do based on whether the user accepted or declined consent.
    // This is also where you can decide which trackers/ads to use/show based on the trackersArray preferences.
            
    // The trackers available to your application. Each tracker has an id and a status.
    // The id is the unique id for that tracker, and the status is a boolean value (true or false).            
    print("Trackers: \(trackers.debugDescription)")

}
```

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance] showConsentFlowWithOnClose:^(BOOL consentAccepted, BOOL consentSkipped, NSDictionary *trackers) {
// TODO: Handle what you want to do based on whether the user accepted or declined consent.
// This is also where you can decide which trackers/ads to use/show based on the trackersArray preferences.

// The trackers available to your application. Each tracker has an id and a status.
// The id is the unique id for that tracker, and the status is a boolean value (YES or NO).
NSLog(@"Trackers: %@",[trackers debugDescription]);

}];
```

### Tracking Preferences <a name="preferences"></a>
Users can toggle trackers on or off. To present the tracking preferences screen:

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().showManagePreferences { () -> Void in
    // TODO: Handle what you want to do after the preferences screen is closed.
            
    // Get the newly updated tracker preferences
    if let updatedTrackers = AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().getTrackerPreferences() as? Dictionary<String, NSNumber> {
        // TODO: Do something with the updated trackers
    }
}
```

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance]showManagePreferences:^{
// TODO: Handle what you want to do after the preferences screen is closed.

//Get the newly updated tracker preferences
NSDictionary *updatedTrackers = [[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance] getTrackerPreferences];

}];
```

### Customization of UI and Consent Messages

In the `AppNotice.bundle` there is a `Configuration.plist` file. This file allows you to customize UI properties and the text shown when your application asks the user for consent:

![](http://i.imgur.com/m2GissI.png)

By default this `Configuration.plist` file will not be used and the SDK will instead grab settings from the server (remote).

#### Use Remote Values

To use your local file you need to set `useRemoteValues` to `false`:

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().useRemoteValues = false
```

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance].useRemoteValues = NO;
```

### Localization

The AppNotice SDK supports multiple languages (currently English, French, Italian, Dutch, German, and Spanish). If your app supports localization for a supported language, the AppNotice SDK will also be displayed in that langauge. To localize your app, you simply need a localization file in your project for each language you support.

To customize any of the strings shown in the SDK, simply open the localization file in the `AppNotice.bundle` for the language you want to customize and change the value (not the key). For example, this screenshot highlights the English text to change for the `ghostery_dialog_explicit_message` key:

### Supporting Multiple App Versions

To support versions of your app that each have a different set of trackers, use unique App Notice configurations in each version of your app. Use the Ghostery control panel (https://my.ghosteryenterprise.com) to create an App Notice configuration for each version of your app that has a different combination of trackers.

After creating an App Notice, make sure to use the correct App Notice ID in your app when you initialize the SDK as [shown above](#activation).
