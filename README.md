##Example Projects

This repo comes with two example projects - one in Objective-C and the other in Swift. They demonstrate how to use the SDK

## Installation

To use the AppNoticeSDK first download or clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ghostery/AppNoticeSDK-iOS.git
```

To integrate AppNoticeSDK into your Xcode project:

Copy/drag `AppNoticeSDKFramework.framework` and `AppNotice.bundle` into your Xcode project:

### Objective-C

Simply include the framework import statement wherever you want to use it

```objective-c
#import <AppNoticeSDKFramework/AppNoticeSDKFramework.h>
```
### Swift

  1.  Creating a bridging header file:

  2.  Include the Objective-C import inside that bridging header:

```objective-c
//  Triangle_swift-Bridging-Header.h
//  Triangle_swift

```


## Usage

### Activation

You must activate the SDK before you can use the SDK features. You do so using your Company Id and Publisher Notice Id.

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance]activateWithCompanyId:@"242" pubNoticeId:@"6107"];
```

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().activateWithCompanyId("242", pubNoticeId: "6107")
```

### Asking For Consent

There are two types of consent, **Implied** and **Explicit**. Implied consent only need appear to the user and does not have **Accept** or **Decline** options. Explicit consent must be accepted or declined. If declined, user should not be permitted to use your application features until consent is accepted. You should show this dialog as soon as possible in your application.

Implied or Explicit is determined by your Publisher Notice Id. You make one call to present the consent dialog:

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance]showConsentFlowWithOnClose:^(BOOL consentAccepted, BOOL consentSkipped, NSDictionary *trackers) {
        //Handle what you want to do if the user gives consent or not. This is also where you can decide which trackers/ads to use/show based on the trackersArray preferences
        
        //The trackers available to your application. Each tracker has an id and a status. The id is the unique id for that tracker, and the status is a boolean value of on or off
        NSLog(@"Trackers: %@",[trackers debugDescription]);
        
    }];
```

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().showConsentFlowWithOnClose { (consentAccepted, consentSkipped, trackers) -> Void in
            //Handle what you want to do if the user gives consent or not. This is also where you can decide which trackers/ads to use/show based on the trackersArray preferences
            
            //The trackers available to your application. Each tracker has an id and a status. The id is the unique id for that tracker, and the status is a boolean value of on or off
            
            print("Trackers: \(trackers.debugDescription)")

        }
```

### Tracking Preferences
Users can toggle trackers On and Off. To present the tracking preferences screen:

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance]showManagePreferences:^{
        //Handle what you want to do after the preferences screen is closed
        
        //Get the newly updated tracker preferences
        NSDictionary *updatedTrackers = [[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance]getTrackerPreferences];
        
    }];
```
##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().showManagePreferences { () -> Void in
            //Handle what you want to do after the preferences screen is closed
            
            //Get the newly updated tracker preferences
            if let updatedTrackers = AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().getTrackerPreferences() as? Dictionary<String, NSNumber> {
                //Do something with updated trackers
            }
        }
```

### Configuration

In the `AppNotice.bundle` there is a `Configuration.plist` that you can configure to customize your specific application:

![](http://i.imgur.com/GHQamgR.png)

By default this `Configuration.plist` file will not be used and the SDK will instead grab settings from the server (remote).

To use your local file you need to set `useRemoteValues` to `false`:

##### Objective-C

```objective-c
[AppNoticeSDK sharedInstance].useRemoteValues = NO;
```

##### Swift

```swift
AppNoticeSDK.sharedInstance().useRemoteValues = false
```
